## PyPoll
One of the Projects here, PyPoll, takes a set of voting data and returns a file that breaks down:
-voting total
-election candidates
-percentage distribution per candidate
-the winner of the election
### Resources
Pypoll only requires Python 3 to run, and the analysis will show up in the Analysis folder (you may have to create it).
