### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to give those who want to possibiliy build a surf
shack a sense of feasibility.  Looking at extreme ends of the year (June and December)
and seeing how they change over both the month and generally over the years to give a
best case and worse case scenario on opening up the business.

## Interesing data worth noticing:

1) Looking at both, the standard deviation is only about 3.75 degrees.  In June, the average temperature was 75 degrees with the upper quartile being 77 degrees, well within the standard deviation which means that in general in June we have fairly constant good whether from 72 to 78 degrees

2)In December, the average temperature was 71 degrees with the upper quartile being 74 degrees which is on the upper end of the standard deviation which means that in general in December we have fairly constant good whether from 71 to 74 degrees and it even peaks in the low 80's, which makes December weather adequate surfing weather

3)On both sides of the year, summer and winter respectively, the weather if fairly similar with averages only being 4 degrees apart in the 70's and having similar max temperature in the 80's which would imply that the temperatures don't get extreme.

## Further Data
Other data to look into would be days of rain and which days rain along with queries on how many stations are reporting to talk about quality of data collected
